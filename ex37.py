KEYWORDS:
and = Called Logical AND operator. If both the operands are true then
the condition becomes true.
del = Deletes objects.
from = For importing a specific variable, class or a funtion from a module.
not = Called Logical NOT Operator. Use to reverses the logical state of its
operand. If a condition is true then Logical NOT operator will make false.
while = Controlling the flow of the program
as = If we want to give a module a different alias.
elif = Stands for else if. If the first test evaluates to False, then
it continues with the next one.
global = Access variables defined outside functions.
or = Called Logical OR Operator. If any of the two operands are non zero then condition becomes true.
with = It’s handy when you have two related operations which you’d like to execute as a pair, with a block of code in between. 
The classic example is opening a file, manipulating the file, then closing it.
assert = Used for debugging purposes.
else = Is optional. The statement after the else keyword is executed, unless the condition is true.
if = used to determine, which statements are going to be executed.
pass = Does nothing.
yield = Is used with generators.
break = Interrupt the (loop) cycle, if needed
except = Catches the exception and executes codes.
import = import other modules into a Python script.
print = Print to console
class = Used to create new user defined objects.
exec = Executes Python code dynamically.
not in = Evaluates to true if it does not find a variable in the specified
sequence and false otherwise.
in = Evaluates to true if it finds a variable in the specified sequence and false otherwise.
raise = Create a user defined exception.
continue = Used to interrupt the current cycle, without jumping out of the whole cycle.
New cycle will begin.
finally = Is always executed in the end. Used to clean up resources.
is = Evaluates to true if the variables on either side of the operator point to the same
object and false otherwise.
return = Exits the function and returns a value.
def = Used to create a new user defined function.
for = Iterate over items of a collection in order that they appear.
lambda = Creates a new anonymous function.
try = Specifies exceptions handlers.

DATA TYPES:
True = Boolean type, if or while true do this, else false do that.
False = Boolean type, if or while false do this, else do true statement.
None = Not known or empty.
strings = Inside quotation marks ("This is a string").
numbers = Store numeric values (1,2,3,4). Four different numerical types:
int, long, float, complex.
floats = Floating point real values.
lists = Contains items separated by commas and enclosed within square brackets ([]). 
Example of list : list = [bear, monster, duck, dog].

STRING FORMATS:
%d = signed integer decimal.
%i = Signed integer decimal.
%o = Unsigned octal.
%u = Unsigned decimal.
%x = Unsigned hexadecimal (lowercase).
%X = Unsigned hexadecimal (uppercase).
%e = Floating point exponential format (lowercase).
%E = Floating point exponential format (uppercase).
%f = Floating point decimal format.
%F = Floating pint decimal format.
%g = Floating point format. Uses exponential format if exponent is greater than -4 or less than 
precision, decimal format otherwise.
%G = Floating point format. Uses exponential format if exponent is greather than -4 or less than 
precision, decimal format otherwise.
%c = Single character (accepts integer or single character string)
%r = String (converts any python object using repr())
%s = String (converts any python object using str())
%% = No argument is converted, results in a "%" character in the result.

OPERATORS:
+ -Addition - adds values on either side of the operator.
- -Subtraction - subtracts right hand operand from left hand operand.
* -Multiplication - multiplies values on either side of the operator.
** -Exponent - performs exponential (power) calculation on operators
/ -Division - divides left hand operand by right hand operand.
// -Floor Division - the division of operands where the result is the quotient in 
which the digits after the decimal point are removed.
% -Modulus - Divides left hand operand by right hand operand returns remainder.
< -Checks if the vale of left operand is less than the value of right operand, if 
yes then the condition becomes true.
> -Checks if the value of the left operand is greater than the value of the 
right operand, if yes then the condition becomes true.
<= -Checks if the value of the left operand is less than or equal to the value of the right operand,
if yes, then the condition becomes true.
>= -Checks if the value on the left operand is greater than or equal to the value
of the right operand, if yes then the condition becomes true.
== -Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not, if yes then the condition become true.
!= -Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not, if values are not
equal then condition becomes true.
<> -Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not, if values are not
equal then condition becomes true.
( ) -

= -Simple assignment operator, Assigns values from right side oprads
to left side operand.
; -
+= -Add AND assignment operator, it adds right operand to the left operand and 
assign the result to left operand.
-= -Subtract AND assignment operator, it subtracts right operand from the left operand
and assign the result to left operand.
*= -Multiply AND assignment operator, it multiplies right operands with the left
operand and assign the result to left operand.
/= Divide AND assignment operator, it divides left operand with the right operand
and assigns the result to left operand.
//= -Floor Dividion and assigns a value, performs floor division on operators and assign
value to the left operand.
%= -Modulus AND assignment operator, it takes modulus using two operands and assign
the result to left operand.
**= -Exponent AND assignment operator, performs exponential (power) calculation
on operators and assign value to the left operand.

STRING ESCAPE SEQUENCES:
\\ = backslash
\" = Double quote
\a = This character may cause the device recieving it to emit a warning of some
kind (usually audible).
\b = Backspace is used either to erase the last character printed
or to overprint it.
\f = Form feed is an ASCII control character. It forces the printer
to eject the current page and to continue printing
at the top of another. Often, it will also cause a carriage return.
\n = Goes to the next line (newline escape).
\r = Carriage return, often shortened to CR or return, refers to a 
control character or mechanism used to reset a deviceæs position to the beginning
of a line of text.
\t = The horizontal tab is usually generated by the Tab key. Standardized tabs are set at every multiple of 8 charcters
horizontally. \t has the same effect.
\v A vertical tab is set at every multiple of 6 lines.

FLOW CHART:
A flow chart is used to solve problems. It is used to see the flow in a program. 
From the start to the end, what happens and which problems can we meet and avoid.
It's helpful because it splits the code into easier and more readable parts, so it is not
so difficult to solve problems or avoid them.
