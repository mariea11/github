# We print som text at first and the we print the string value from the variable.
# When we wrote the days in the variable right after eachother without any commas or other signs
# they print out just the way they are put in the variable.
print "Here are the days: ", days

#When we write an \n before the text, the text will print on the next line.
print "Here are the months: ", months

# We print a text, and by using three """, we can write as much as we want to.

There's something going on here.

We'll be able to type as much as we like.
Even 4 lines if we want, or 5, or 6.
